# Karmic Rules for Writing Pretty Good Code

In order by insertion:

0. Minimize external dependencies and try not to use shitty libraries.

0. Troubleshooting works just like the regular kind: you won't hit your target if you don't have one.

0. Nothing raises issues like contact with reality.

0. If you want to get a complex process right, template it.
